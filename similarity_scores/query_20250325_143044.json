      "text": "The HOG transform (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) was first introduced conceptually in 1986, but wasn't popularized in classification until 2005 when Navneet Dalal and Bill Triggs presented supplementary work on the concept at CVPR. [1] HOG transforms are motivated by the fact that object appearances within an image can be described by the intensity of their gradients. In application, the descriptor splits an image into cells, and computes the histograms of gradient directions for each cell. The compilation of all the cell's histograms constitutes the output of the HOG transform. HOG is particularly useful for capturing the shape and texture information of objects, and is renowned for its efficacy in classification tasks.",

      "text": "Invented by David Lowe in 1999, [2] SIFT descriptors (Scale Invariant Feature transform) are very similar to the HOG transform. They also compute the 'edginess' of pixels through gradient orientation, but instead of computing in blocks over a whole image, they calculate points of interest on which to focus. This keypoint detection is one of the main features that separate the two methods. Because of this focus on points of interest, SIFT descriptors often excel in object recognition tasks, rather than classifying entire images.\nMore detailed analyses of the specific computations and strengths of each of these methods is surely useful, but outside\nthe scope of this project. We find it sufficient to say that each of these methods serves to extract features from input images, and the efficacy of each is worth testing in our specific classification problem.",
