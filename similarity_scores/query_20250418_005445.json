      "text": "In the case of STCs, where some (or much) of the activity may be imbedded within metal particulates, a significant portion of the beta energy may be attenuated before the beta particle reaches any tissue.  Thus, for the source and target organs in which STCs may be present (the compartments of the respiratory tract and GI tract as indicated in red text in the Table above) an energy 'Self Absorption Factor' must be applied to the 'normal' tritium SEE for that source and target region.\nThese energy Self Absorption Factors (defined as the fraction of beta energy emitted from the STC particle) is a complex function of the material density, and the size and shape of the particle.  These SAFe values can range from about 1.0 (100% of energy emitted) for very small, low density materials, down to about 0.1 (10% of energy emitted) for large particle, high density materials.",

As might be expected, the SAFe value (fraction of energy emitted) drops dramatically as the particle diameter increases. As the AMAD drops below about 0.1 microns, the value of SAFe asymptotes to 1.0 (100% of the energy is available for deposition in tissue).  One can also see a 'spread' in values as a function of the material density.  This spread is most dramatic at the larger AMAD values.",

One can also see a 'spread' in values as a function of the material density.\nAs the AMAD drops below about 0.1 microns, the value of SAF  asymptotes to a value of 1.0 \uf062 (100% of beta particles escape the STC particle and are counted.)  Unfortunately, the Mathcad log-normal function used to calculate SAF  values fails at AMAD values less than 0.1.  In order \uf062 to conservatively 'work around' this problem, SAF  values from 0.09 microns to 0.05 microns \uf062 AMAD are assumed to be 0.95 for all materials, and SAF  values below 0.05 microns AMAD \uf062 are assumed to be equal to 1.0 for all materials.  These assumptions produce the step-function like appearance seen at small particle size distributions in Figure C.8.48.\nFigure C.8.48",
