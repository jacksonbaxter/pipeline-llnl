This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is d model = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality d ff = 2048 .",
