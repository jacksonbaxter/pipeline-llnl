      "text": "The key assumptions used for dosimetry modeling of inhalation intakes of STCs are as follows:\n1. The ICRP-66 respiratory tract model is used to calculate the deposition, retention, and absorption of inhaled Type F, Type M, and Type S tritiated particulates,\n2. The tritiated particulate is assumed to behave like the substrate (e.g., titanium, in the case of titanium-tritide) until it is absorbed from the respiratory tract and/or the GI tract  into the bloodstream,\n3. Unless specifically stated otherwise, f1 values for absorption from the GI Tract to the bloodstream are based on the substrate element, and taken from Table B.1. of ICRP-68,\n4. Upon absorption into the bloodstream (from either the lungs or GI Tract), the tritium is assumed to follow the biokinetic model of HTO,\n5. The beta particle emissions from tritium activity within STC particles in the respiratory tract or GI Tract regions are assumed to be attenuated.  The amount of attenuation is described by an energy 'Self Absorption Factor' or SAFe value - that represents the fraction of beta energy emitted from the particle. Currently, LLNL is using the methodology used by the Mound Technical Basis Document (Mound 2001) to calculate these SAFe values.\n(Note that these SAFe values are different from the 'beta particle Self Absorption Factors' SAF \uf062 which are used to convert 'observed' LSC activity to 'actual' LSC activity (see discussion below in Section C.8.7).)",

      "text": "The key to calculation of dose conversion factors for STCs is the use of the above-discussed energy self-absorption factors to correct for the fraction of tritium beta energy that does not escape from the STC particle, and therefore does not contribute to organ doses.  As discussed in Section C.8.3, this correction is applied to doses received by the various regions of the lungs and the GI tract while the STC activity is assumed to be in particulate form.  Once the tritium in the STC particulate is 'absorbed' (transformed into HTO), it is treated as 'normal' tritiated water, and the standard ICRP dosimetry assumptions (and standard SEE values) for tritiated water are used.\nThe correction for the energy self-absorption factor may be applied prospectively to either the specific effective energy (SEE) values used to calculate the pertinent organ doses, or retrospectively to the organ doses calculated using 'standard' SEE values.",
