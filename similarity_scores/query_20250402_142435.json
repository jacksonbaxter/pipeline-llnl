As such, we will report classification accuracies for both datasets, to give insight into the methods of model choice. A note here -we decided that given our application, accuracy would be our most applicable evaluation metric. We toyed with the idea of using precision, recall, and F1, but in determining fetal gender, accuracy would provide us with the most effective measure of success (As there is no reason to minimize type 1 or type 2 error).",

This paper builds on the techniques for data collection used in their paper, applied to a better curated dataset provided by a local healthcare provider, to achieve a different application.",
